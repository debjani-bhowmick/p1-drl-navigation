## Introduction

This project and the associated code are meant to serve as an assignment project for the partial fulfilment of the Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree.The project aim is to  **Train an agent to navigate a virtual world and collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas**

![In Project 1, train an agent to navigate a large world.](images/banana_agent.gif)

In this setup the aegnt gets +1 when it collects a yellow banana and -1 when it collects blue ones. The reinforcement learning system actions are directed to wards maximizing cumulative scores thus, the agent tries to end up with a policy which says itâ€™s better to avoid the blue ones and collect more yellows, by changing its actions on certain states.

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +16 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Method

The way `Navigation.ipynb` unfolds:
1. Initialize the agent 
2. Evaluate state and action space
3. Learn from it using Deep Q-Networks (DQN). 
4. Iterate until agent reaches a threshold score of 16.0

## Getting Started

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.

2. Place the file in the working folder and unzip the file
